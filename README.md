# Coping-with-Dyslexia

Dyslexia is a specific language disorder that causes problem in reading, writing and speaking. It is neurobiological in origin. It is characterized by poor word recognition, spelling and decoding abilities despite having higher cognitive abilities and receiving effective classroom experience.

**Why it is necessary to find a solution?**

It can be estimated that teachers will have between one and five dyslexic students in each class. If left untreated, dyslexics will develop low self-esteem and poor confidence.
Some researchers claimed it to be just a visual issue. Studies found children with dyslexia and without dyslexia to have
similar visual conditions.
