Dyslexia is a specific language disorder that causes problem in reading, writing and speaking. It is neurobiological in origin. It is characterized by poor word recognition, spelling and decoding abilities despite having higher cognitive abilities and receiving effective classroom experience.

**Why it is necessary to find a solution?**

similar visual conditions.
